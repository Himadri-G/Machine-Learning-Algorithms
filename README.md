# Time Series Analysis

This repository is dedicated to exploring and understanding Time Series Analysis. Here, I am performing noise checking and filtering the noise using a Simple Moving Average. For noise checking, I used statistical methods.

## Steps

1. **Calculate the Mean (𝜇):**

   The mean (\(\mu\)) is calculated using the following formula:

   $$
   \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i
   $$

   This formula represents the average of a set of values.

2. **Calculate the Standard Deviation (𝜎):**

   The standard deviation (\(\Sigma\)) is calculated as:
